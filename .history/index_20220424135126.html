        <h1 style="background-color:rgb(182, 135, 179);">About Me</h1>
        <p>Below you will find my aspirations, hobbies and interests. In the following paragraph I will be talking about those in a bit more detail and what they entail. I am quite fond of all because they have shaped the person I am today to a certain extent.</p>
        <p>A couple of my aspirations as you will see in the table below are to travel, some destinations include Japan, Germany, Oregon and Washington State. To graduate and to be a full-time developer later in my career. My interest are coding of course, going to the gym and doing research every now and then on health related topics for example how plastic is affecting our bodies. Last but ceratinly not least are my hobbies which include climbing which I had wanted to try for a long time and took it up a couple years ago. Painting is one of the older ones which I practice every now and then and Running which I have found to be a good part of my daily routine. </p>

      <h1> <span style= "color: greenyellow;">CSIS 1030 Final Reflection</span></h1>
      <br>
      <p>In this class I have really enjoyed learning about all the concepts ranging from learning a little about web design to internet safety. The most eye opening learning experience was navigating to certain websites provided to find out if some of our information is secure and reflection on that and describing elements we would change to better optimize our web navigation safely.   </p>
