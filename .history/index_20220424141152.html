        <p>Below you will find my aspirations, hobbies and interests. In the following paragraph I will be talking about those in a bit more detail and what they entail. I am quite fond of all because they have shaped the person I am today to a certain extent.</p>
        <p>A couple of my aspirations as you will see in the table below are to travel, some destinations include Japan, Germany, Oregon and Washington State. To graduate and to be a full-time developer later in my career. My interest are coding of course, going to the gym and doing research every now and then on health related topics for example how plastic is affecting our bodies. Last but ceratinly not least are my hobbies which include climbing which I had wanted to try for a long time and took it up a couple years ago. Painting is one of the older ones which I practice every now and then and Running which I have found to be a good part of my daily routine. </p>

      <br>
      <p>In this class I have really enjoyed learning about all the concepts ranging from web design to internet safety. The most eye opening learning experience was navigating to certain websites provided to find out if some of our information is secure and reflecting on that and describing elements we would change to better optimize our web navigation safely.   </p>
      <p>The jobs available for developers in todays market range widely, some require certain degrees while others require no degree at all as long as candidates can showcase their skills. There are many jobs on sites like linkedin, ksl and indeed among others in which those looking for a job in the field can apply for jobs as interns or junior developers if they are just beginning. Some jobs that I found recently are for companies such as The Red Cross working remotely.</p>
      <p>The certificate I need to apply for a job and which I am pursuing at the moment is the Computer Science and Information Systems AAS, which will allow me to get into the workforce in this developing industry.</p>
      <p>The Salaries range from company to company, I am interested in an internship position and I would say that the average is 40k a year for just starting out and perhaps without previous work experience in the field.</p>
      <p>I do not believe there to be any barriers that may hinder my completion, I have all the tools available for my success which I am very grateful for.</p>
      <p>My least favorite topic in the course was SQL for no particular reason other than it is not the type of coding that I am into and thus proved to be harder to learn but with practice am better at it and hope to learn more about it.</p>
